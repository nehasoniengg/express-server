#Client-server architecture
_________________________________________
Client/server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This type of architecture has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection. This system shares computing resources.

Client/server architecture is also known as a networking computing model or client/server network because all the requests and services are delivered over a network.

Client/server architecture is a producer/consumer computing architecture where the server acts as the producer and the client as a consumer. The server houses and provides high-end, computing-intensive services to the client on demand. These services can include application access, storage, file sharing, printer access and/or direct access to the serverâ€™s raw computing power.
