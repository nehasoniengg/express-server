##Plugins of VS-code .

**1) Setting sync :-** It allows you to sync pretty much everything you customize on VSCode to Github, from settings to keyboard shortcuts to other VSCode extensions.

**2) Bracket pair colorizer:-** Bracket Pair Colorizer gives the opening and closing brackets matching colors, making it much easier to know which brackets belong together.
**3) Auto rename teg:-** VSCode inherently highlights matching tags and immediately adds closing tags whenever you type an opening tag, Auto Rename Tag automatically renames tags that you change.The extension works for HTML, XML, PHP, and JavaScript, and removes the need to change your tag names twice.
**4) Javascript code Snippets :-** JS Code Snippets enhances that experience by adding a slew of import/export triggers, class helpers, and method triggers.
**5) Code spell checker:-** Although it isn't life-threateningly important, I prefer my code to have no spelling errors. Code Spell Checker underlines words that it doesn't recognize in its dictionary files.
**6) Debugger of chrome:-** Debugger for Chrome allows you to debug your JS code in VSCode. Contrary to debuggers in other IDEs, it's surprisingly smooth.
**7) Regex previewer :-** Regular expressions can be quite the puzzle to get right. Regex Previewer gives you a side document that matches your regex.
**8) Live server:-** Live Server launches a local development server with a live reload feature both for static and dynamic pages.
